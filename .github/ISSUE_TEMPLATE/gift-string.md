# String Guidelines
- Strings should be in the general format of `{0} just sent (a/an) <Emoji> <Name> to {1}. <Flavor Text>`.
- Strings must be grammatically correct, safe for work, appropriate, and not include any special formatting (with the exception of emoji formatting.)
- Emojis must be normal unicode or official Blob Emoji. Include the raw emoji for normal unicode emoji or `<:name:id>` formatting for Discord emoji. Only in special/rare cases will other custom emoji be used. 

<!-- Replace [ ] below with [x] to tick this checkbox. -->
- [ ] All of my suggestions meet these guidelines.
